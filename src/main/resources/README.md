# Toggl-to-Jira-Chrome-Extension
Sync toggl time entries with Jira work log


Converts Toggl time entries to *log work* on corresponding Jira tasks
If your project requires you to log work on Jira tasks and issues, its not possible to import from Toggl. Server side Toggl-Jira integrations cost money or won't work in the cloud.

This simple extension allows you to post your Toggl entries to the corresponding Jira tasks automatically.

You need to be logged in to Toggl.com and your Jira board, so the cookies are available in the browser. Configure your Jira server url in options.
